<h2>
  Instructions:
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preparation:</li>
  <ul><li>Ensure that your rice is cooked and cooled. Day-old rice works best for fried rice as it tends to be less sticky.</li></ul>
  <li>Vegetables:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In a large pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the mixed vegetables and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until they are tender-crisp. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Eggs:</li>  
  <ul>
    <li>In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.</li>
    <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the pan and scramble them. Cook until they are just set.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Combine Ingredients:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Add the cooked rice to the pan with the scrambled eggs. Use a spatula to break up any clumps of rice.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Flavoring:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Drizzle soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice and eggs. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and continue to stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Vegetables Return:</li>

  <li></li>
  </ul>

  <li>Seasoning:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Be cautious with salt as the soy sauce already adds saltiness.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Finish:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Drizzle sesame oil over the fried rice and stir to combine.</li>
    <li> Add chopped green onions and stir once more.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Serve:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Once everything is well-mixed and heated through, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
    <li>Serve the fried rice hot and enjoy!</li>
  </ul>  
</ol>
